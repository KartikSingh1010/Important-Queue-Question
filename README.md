# Important-Queue-Question

This repository contains a collection of essential queue-related questions in Java, frequently asked in technical interviews. The main purpose is to assist users in revising these key concepts and questions as needed.

## Introduction to Queues

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are widely used in various applications, including scheduling processes in operating systems, handling requests in web servers, and implementing breadth-first search algorithms in graphs.

### Basic Operations

1. **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removing the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Getting the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **Rear**: Getting the element at the end of the queue.
5. **isEmpty**: Checking if the queue is empty.
6. **isFull**: (Applicable to bounded queues) Checking if the queue is full.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews by providing a curated list of queue-related questions. Each file contains a Java implementation of a common queue problem, along with explanations to help you understand the underlying concepts.

## Installation

To use the files in this repository, clone it to your local machine and open the files in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Important-Queue-Question.git
```

## Usage

1. **Open the repository**: Launch Visual Studio Code and open the cloned repository.
2. **Navigate to Java files**: Browse through the Java files that contain various queue questions.
3. **Review and run the code**: Examine the code to understand the implementation and logic behind each solution.

These questions are intended to help you revise and prepare for interviews by providing practical examples and solutions to common queue problems.

## Example Questions

Here are some examples of the types of questions you'll find in this repository:

1. **Implementing a Queue using Arrays**
2. **Implementing a Queue using Linked Lists**
3. **Circular Queue Implementation**
4. **Priority Queue Implementation**
5. **Deque (Double-ended Queue) Implementation**
6. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) using a Queue**

Each question is accompanied by a detailed solution in Java to help you grasp the concepts thoroughly.
